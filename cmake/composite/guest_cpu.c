// The guest CPU's state, kept in the module at a fixed address.
//
// Translated code reaches every register and flag through its CPUState. With
// a pointer parameter the pointer needs a host register for the whole of a
// chunk, and a chunk is one function of 4,096 instructions with a label per
// instruction: on x86-64's 16 registers clang keeps spilling it, so most
// fields are read through a reload of the pointer first (about 32,000
// reloads in one chunk). The Windows builder rewrites the chunks to address
// this object directly (scripts/windows/global_guest_cpu.py), which removes
// 95 percent of those reloads. The host runs the guest on this object when the
// module offers it (bluewake_composite_guest_cpu), so there is one state.
