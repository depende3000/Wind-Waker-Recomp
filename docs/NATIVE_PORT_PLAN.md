# Native port plan: Wind Waker from its decompilation, on Aurora

**Branch:** `feature/switch-native` (from `feature/switch-port`) · **Started:** 2026-10-03

## Why

The translated build (DolRecomp → C) runs the whole game on the Switch, with Aurora, controller,
sound and rumble, but at 6-8 percent of real time at the stock 1020 MHz (3.7-4.7 retraces a second
against 60; `docs/SWITCH_IMPLEMENTATION_CHECKLIST.md`). On Apple M-class cores that translation
already keeps a core 80-100 percent busy; no translator change is likely to give the ~13x the Switch
needs (DolRecomp's LLVM backend measured slower than its C backend in August; the C emitter's cheap
levers are measured and spent). Native code from the decompilation costs about 0.9 host
instructions per guest instruction against about 27 for the translation
(`docs/status/ROUTE_DECISION_2026-09-22.md`). The CPU stays at its stock clock.

## Inputs

- **Game source:** `native/tww/`, the snrubrm/tww fork of the zeldaret decompilation imported
  unchanged at `b09eebc` (`native/README.md`). Hito 0: its Metrowerks build reproduces this disc's
  `main.dol` and 415 RELs byte for byte (`416 files OK`).
- **Reference port:** Dusklight (Twilight Princess on Aurora, CC0), in `ref/dusklight` for study:
  `libs/dolphin` (the GameCube SDK over Aurora), `src/c/c_dylink.cpp` (RELs linked statically),
  `include/helpers/endian.h` and `offset_ptr.h` (big-endian disc data, relative pointers), its
  `TARGET_PC` changes to the decompiled game (345 files), C++20 with a precompiled header.
- **Switch layer already proven on the console** (`switch/`): Aurora with Dawn on Mesa GLES and a
  window surface, the SDL 3 shim (HID gamepad with HD rumble, audout, events, SD I/O), the NRO
  packaging, push and live USB log tools.
- **Lessons from this repository's earlier decomp route** ("Route B", August-September 2026, which
  reached a room scene with a patched upstream tww): about 170 `docs/status/ROUTE_B_*.md` notes.

## Phases

1. **Native build on the Mac.** A CMake project under `native/` that compiles `native/tww` with
   clang for arm64 (C++20, `TARGET_PC`, the host C library instead of Metrowerks' MSL), unit by
   unit: SSystem, JSystem (JKernel, JSupport, JUtility, JMath, J3D, J2D, JParticle…), then the game
   framework (`f_*`, `m_Do`, `d/`) and the actors. Assets headers generated from the player's disc
   at build time, outside the repository.
2. **The GameCube SDK over Aurora** (`dolphin/` OS, GX, VI, PAD, DVD, CARD, AR, DSP), with
   Dusklight's `libs/dolphin` as the model; Aurora already provides GX, VI, PAD, OS, SI, MTX.
3. **RELs linked statically** into one executable, following Dusklight's `c_dylink`.
4. **64-bit and endianness:** pointers stored in 32-bit fields, structures read straight from disc
   data (big-endian), alignment and padding assumptions; Dusklight's `BE<T>` and `offset_ptr`.
5. **Audio (JAudio1, `JAZelAudio`):** Dusklight has JAudio2 only; port the decomp's JAudio1 to the
   host DSP/audio path.
6. **Milestones on the Mac:** boot to the title, then controllable Outset; measure the game thread's
   milliseconds per frame on an M-class core and extrapolate to the Cortex-A57 (must leave margin
   under 33 ms at 1020 MHz).
7. **The Switch:** cross-compile with devkitA64, reuse `switch/` (Aurora, shim, NRO, SD, logs).

Phase 2 and 3 step plan and decisions: `docs/NATIVE_PORT_PHASE2_3.md`.

Each phase lands as its own commits; this file records decisions and measured results as they come.

## Phase 1 log

- **scaffold:** CMake project under `native/` (Ninja, arm64, C11/C++20), `tww_game_headers` with
  `TARGET_PC=1`, `VERSION=2`, `NDEBUG=1` and the force-included `native/include/pc/tww_pc_config.h`
  (portable `__cntlzw`, `__rlwimi`, `__dcbz`, `__sync`, `__fres`, `__frsqrte`; MSL's float math in
  `std::`), MSL header-name shims, 14 module targets covering all 840 in-scope units (off by
  default), `tww_defer()` list (empty). `s32`/`u32` are `int` under `TARGET_PC` and the intrinsic
  declarations in `global.h` are original-target only. Check target: 2/2 units, 0 deferred.
- **SSystem:** 36/36 units compile, 0 deferred; module on by default (`TWW_MODULES_READY`).
  MSL's `std::__tag_va_List` added to the compat header; pointer-to-integer casts in
  `JKRExpHeap::CMemBlock::getBlock` and `cBgS::ConvDzb` go through `uintptr_t` under `TARGET_PC`
  (`TODO(native phase 4)`: 0x10 block header and 32-bit dzb offsets).
- **JSystem-core:** 59/59 units (JKernel, JSupport, JUtility, JMath, JGadget, JFramework,
  JRenderer) compile, 0 deferred; on by default. Compat header: `<cctype>`, `<cstdio>`,
  `<cstdlib>`, `<cstring>` so MSL's `std::strrchr`/`std::tolower` resolve; MSL shim
  `msl_memory.h` (host `<memory>`). `JGadget_outMessage`'s `int`/`uint` overloads are
  original-target only (they redeclare the `s32`/`u32` ones when those are `int`).
  Pointer-to-integer casts (about 100, mostly JKernel heaps and archives, `JSUConvertOffsetToPtr`,
  `OSRoundUp32B`/`OSRoundUpPtr`/`OSRoundDownPtr`) go through `uintptr_t`/`intptr_t` under
  `TARGET_PC`; values still stored in `u32` fields/locals are phase 4 (`TODO(native phase 4)`
  on `TVector::size`'s `/ 4`).
- **JSystem-J3D:** 31/31 units (J3DGraphBase, J3DGraphAnimator, J3DGraphLoader, J3DU) compile,
  0 deferred; on by default. About 50 pointer-to-`u32` cast sites (hashes, `mDiffFlag`, file
  offsets kept in pointer-typed fields, GX array base, vertex counts from pointer differences) go
  through `uintptr_t`/`intptr_t` under `TARGET_PC` with `TODO(native phase 4)`; where the result
  becomes a pointer again the base is not truncated. `OSCachedToPhysical`/`OSUncachedToPhysical`
  in `OS.h` fixed at the macro. `J3DMaterialFactory_v21::create`'s declaration spells `u32` like
  its definition (was `unsigned long`, MWCC's `u32`).
- **JSystem-2D-particle:** 26/26 units (J2DGraph 8, JParticle 18; JRenderer already in
  JSystem-core) compile, 0 deferred; on by default. Only `J2DPrint.cpp` needed changes: the
  pointer differences compared as `u32` in `parse` and the hex-length checks of
  `getNumberS32`/`getNumberF32` cast each pointer through `uintptr_t` under `TARGET_PC`
  (`TODO(native phase 4)`); modulo-2^32 subtraction gives the original distance.
- **JSystem-studio:** 37/37 units (JStudio with all its adaptor subdirectories, JStage,
  JMessage) compile, 0 deferred; on by default. Compat header gains MSL's `DEG_TO_RAD`/`RAD_TO_DEG`
  (same text, MSL's float pi as `TWW_MSL_M_PI`). `JGadget::search::TExpandStride_` gets
  `long`/`long long` specializations under `TARGET_PC` (host `ptrdiff_t`); `TLinkList_factory`
  calls `this->Erase` (dependent base). Pointer casts in `functionvalue`, `stb`,
  `stb-data-parse`, `jstudio-object` and `object-actor` go through `uintptr_t`/`intptr_t` under
  `TARGET_PC` (`TODO(native phase 4)`; `TFunctionValue_composite::TData` still stores a pointer in
  a `u32`).
- **framework:** 57/57 units (f_pc, f_op, f_ap, c, `DynamicLink.cpp`) compile, 0 deferred; on by
  default. Most units need the asset headers (`d/d_com_inf_game.h` includes `res/Object/Always.h`),
  copied from a built decomp checkout into the gitignored build dir (see `native/README.md`).
  Pointer-to-`u32` casts in `JORMContext::genCheckBox` (`m_Do_hostIO.h`) and in `DynamicLink.cpp`
  (`do_link`'s address assert and `fixSizePtr`, `ModuleUnresolved`'s back-chain walk) go through
  `uintptr_t` under `TARGET_PC` (`TODO(native phase 3/4)`). Original bugs left for phase 4:
  `-Wfortify-source` strcpy overflows in `f_op_msg_mng.cpp` (Rupee strings) and missing returns
  in its `dummyfloat*` stubs.
- **m_Do:** 17/17 units compile, 0 deferred; on by default. `print_f` in
  `m_Do_machine_exception.cpp` runs `va_start`/`va_end` on `args.list` under `TARGET_PC` (MSL
  allowed them on the `std::__tag_va_List` wrapper). The arena bounds in `mDoMch_Create` and the
  stack walks and address checks in `m_Do_printf.cpp` (`OSGetCallerPC`, `search_partial_address`,
  `convert_partial_address`, `OSPanic`) cast pointers through `uintptr_t` under `TARGET_PC`
  (`TODO(native phase 4)`).
- **d-core:** 136/136 units (top level of `src/d`) compile, 0 deferred; on by default.
  `cLib_onBit`/`offBit`/`checkBit`/`setBit` (`c_lib.h`) take a non-deduced bit argument under
  `TARGET_PC` (u32 fields with `0x..UL` literals deduce one `T` only where `u32` is
  `unsigned long`). The compat header predefines the generated display-list macro block
  (`LOAD_BP_REG` & co., same text) with `IMAGE_ADDR` through `uintptr_t`
  (`TODO(native phase 2)`: Aurora GX must resolve DL texture references). `d_meter.cpp`'s global
  `clock[3]` is renamed by macro to `dMeter_clock` under `TARGET_PC` (host `::clock()`). Offset
  relocations in `d_stage`, `d_s_menu`, `d_s_actor_data_mng`, `d_resorce` and the recollection
  buffers in `d_com_inf_game` go through `uintptr_t` under `TARGET_PC` (`TODO(native phase 4)`).
- **actors-1:** 74/74 units (`d_a_acorn_leaf` .. `d_a_fan`) compile, 0 deferred; on by default.
  `J3DModel::setUserArea((u32)this)` passes the pointer as `(uintptr_t)` under `TARGET_PC`
  (`TODO(native phase 4)`: `mUserArea` is still a u32). Locals initialised inside a `switch` and
  bypassed by a later `case` (`d_a_bo`, `d_a_bl`) are declared then assigned under `TARGET_PC`.
  `next_msgStatus(unsigned long*)` (`d_a_dai.h`, `d_a_bigelf`) takes `u32*` under `TARGET_PC`.
  `JGadget::binary` iterators' `operator!=` compares `mBegin` directly under `TARGET_PC`: the
  hidden-friend `operator==` is not found by ADL on the base-class arguments.
- **actors-2:** 74/74 units (`d_a_floor` .. `d_a_npc_aj1`, sorted indices 74-147) compile, 0
  deferred; on by default. Same idioms as actors-1: `setUserArea` casts through `uintptr_t` (24
  sites, `TODO(native phase 4)`), case-bypassed locals declared then assigned (`d_a_gy`, `d_a_gnd`,
  `d_a_kamome`; in `d_a_mt` the bypassed `dAttention_c&` is scoped to its one statement),
  `u32*`/`u32&` instead of `unsigned long` in `d_a_npc_ah.h`, `d_a_npc_aj1.h` and `d_a_lod_bg.h`.
  `d_a_mt` names the `cXyz` temporary whose address it passes. `JGadget/search.h` includes
  `dolphin/types.h` (it used `s32` without it). `d_a_movie_player`'s THP decoder casts its
  addresses through `uintptr_t`; its Huffman/IDCT paths are PowerPC asm under `#ifdef __MWERKS__`
  with no C fallback in the decomp, so on PC they are still empty. Dusklight replaces that decoder
  under `TARGET_PC`; that belongs with the SDK work (phase 2), not here.
- **actors-3:** 74/74 units (`d_a_npc_auction` .. `d_a_obj_barrel`, sorted indices 148-221)
  compile, 0 deferred; on by default. Same idioms again: `setUserArea` casts through `uintptr_t`
  (69 sites in 54 files, `TODO(native phase 4)`); `next_msgStatus(unsigned long*)` and
  `setMessage(unsigned long)` take `u32` under `TARGET_PC` in 16 `d_a_npc_*.h` headers (and the
  `d_a_npc_p2` definition), so the virtual ones override `fopNpc_npc_c`'s again; `d_a_npc_ym1`'s
  `area_check` callback takes `u32`; `d_a_npc_bj1`'s `dist_xz`, bypassed by a `goto`, is declared
  then assigned.
- **actors-4:** 74/74 units (`d_a_obj_barrel2` .. `d_a_obj_nest`, sorted indices 222-295)
  compile, 0 deferred; on by default. Only 13 errors in 11 units, all known idioms:
  `setUserArea` casts through `uintptr_t` (11 sites in 9 files, one of them a `J3DPacket` in
  `d_a_obj_buoyflag`, `TODO(native phase 4)`); `d_a_obj_doguu.h`'s `next_msgStatus` takes `u32*`
  under `TARGET_PC`; `d_a_obj_hcbh`'s case-bypassed `actor` local is declared then assigned.
- **actors-5:** 74/74 units (`d_a_obj_ohatch` .. `d_a_ship`, sorted indices 296-369) compile,
  0 deferred; on by default. 57 errors in 19 units: `setUserArea` casts through `uintptr_t`
  (30 sites in 21 files, one a `J3DPacket` in `d_a_obj_tapestry`, `TODO(native phase 4)`);
  `d_a_player_main` carves its animation buffers and the rock-mark image data by address
  arithmetic on `uintptr_t`; `d_a_obj_tapestry`'s alignment assert uses `uintptr_t`, and its
  `l_HIO` is a file-scope static instead of an anonymous-namespace one (ambiguous with the
  global class `l_HIO`); `d_a_ph`'s two case-bypassed `speed` locals are declared then assigned;
  `d_a_obj_search` passes a named `GXColor` to `dComIfGd_setAlphaModelColor(GXColor&)`;
  `d_a_player_rope.inc` calls `abs((int)u32)`, since only MSL's `abs(int)` made it unambiguous.
- **actors-6:** 71/71 units (`d_a_shop_item` .. `d_a_yougan`, sorted indices 370-440) compile,
  0 deferred; on by default. 15 errors in 13 units, all known idioms: `setUserArea` casts
  through `uintptr_t` (13 sites in 11 files, `TODO(native phase 4)`); `d_a_tag_hint` and
  `d_a_tag_island` declare and define `next_msgStatus` with `u32*` under `TARGET_PC`.

## Phase 2 log

- **2.1 Aurora:** `native/cmake/Aurora.cmake` fetches Aurora at `3227d76` behind `TWW_WITH_AURORA`
  (default OFF), with Dusklight's options (GX, DVD, CARD, THP on; RmlUi off; `aurora_mtx` with
  `MTX_USE_PS=1`) and prebuilt Dawn/nod packages on darwin-arm64. All Aurora SDK libraries build;
  MIT notice in `RIGHTS_AND_LICENSES.md`. Deviation: off GEKKO, Aurora's `<dolphin/mtx.h>` maps
  `PSMTX*` to `C_MTX*` by macro, so `libaurora_mtx.a` exports `_C_MTXConcat`, not `_PSMTXConcat`;
  the 2.2 smoke test calls `PSMTXConcat` through the header instead of looking for the symbol.
- **2.2 tww_sdk skeleton:** `native/cmake/sdk.cmake` (only with `TWW_WITH_AURORA=ON`) globs
  `native/sdk/src/**/*.{c,cpp}` with `CONFIGURE_DEPENDS` into the STATIC `tww_sdk` (Aurora headers
  only, public `MTX_USE_PS=1`, linked to `TWW_AURORA_LIBS`) and `native/sdk/tests/*.cpp` into the
  headless `tww_sdk_smoke`, whose tests self-register by name (`tests/smoke.h`), so 2.6a-f add files
  without touching shared ones. `tww_sdk_smoke` prints `ok` (`basic`: OSInit, OSGetTime,
  PSMTXConcat); Aurora's `OSInit` needs no `aurora_initialize` with the zeroed config.
- **2.3 SDK header mode:** `TWW_SDK_HEADERS=decomp|aurora` in `GameConfig.cmake` (default
  `decomp` until 2.8; `aurora` needs `TWW_WITH_AURORA=ON` and includes `Aurora.cmake` early, which
  now has an include guard). Aurora order: `native/include` → `native/include/sdk` → Aurora
  `include` → `tww/include`, plus `MTX_USE_PS=1` and the force-included
  `native/include/sdk/tww_sdk_extras.h` (`uint`, `READU32_BE`, `FLOAT_MIN/MAX`). Forwarders for the
  16 TWW-only OS, MTX, VI and PAD names (`base/PPCArch.h` collides, so base needs none); TWW-only
  declarations Aurora lacks are added once (`__OSReport_*`, `__OSModuleList`, `SVec`, `MtxP`,
  `Mtx33`, `PADClampRegion`, `VI_3D`...), hardware registers and boot code left out, and
  declarations Aurora has with another signature (`OSGetStackPointer`, `OSBootInfo`'s fields) left
  to Aurora for 2.7. `global.h`, `DynamicLink.h` and `weak_bss_3569.h` include their SDK header with
  `<>` under `TARGET_PC`: a quoted include there is looked up next to the header first, i.e. in
  `native/tww/include/dolphin`, whatever the `-I` order. `tww_sdk_header_check` builds in both
  modes; `tww_sdk_shadow_check` (`check/check_sdk_shadow.sh`) passes for 55 names, 27 pending 2.4.
- **2.4 Remaining forwarders:** the 27 TWW-only GX, GF, DVD, AR, AI, SI, EXI, GBA, DB and amcstubs
  names (GD has none: all three TWW GD names are Aurora's). Each includes Aurora's header and adds
  once what Aurora lacks: `GXColor3x8/4x8` (over `GXColor3u8/4u8`), `GXSetDrawSync`, `GXCopyMode`,
  the GX bit-field macros, `DVDDirectory`/`DVDDirectoryEntry` (= Aurora's `DVDDir`/`DVDDirEntry`;
  field names left to 2.7), `DVDGetLength`, the SI API beyond `SIProbe`, `EXI_STATE_*`, the GBA
  private state, AMC EXI2 and DB link functions, and SDK-internal `__DVD*`/`__GX*` prototypes. TWW-only
  GF declarations go in `native/include/sdk/tww_gf_extras.h` (C++ linkage, register macros taken from
  Aurora's GD headers). Left out on purpose: `GXFIFO` and the macros that write it (J3D moves to
  `GXCmd1u*` in 2.7, so it fails to compile rather than write to 0xCC008000), `GXData`/`gx` and
  the CP/PE/PI registers, `__DIRegs`/`__EXIRegs`/`__SIRegs`, and the `DVDState`/`DVDResult`/
  `ARamType` enums whose enumerators are Aurora macros (Aurora's `DVD_RESULT_CANCELED` is -6, the
  decomp's -3). `native/include/sdk/types.h` forwards the bare `<types.h>` Aurora's `gba.h` includes.
  `tww_sdk_shadow_check`: 82 names checked, 0 pending.
- **2.5 Link census:** `native/cmake/census.cmake` builds the MODULE `tww_link_census` (bundle,
  `-undefined dynamic_lookup`, C++ link, not in `all`) from every enabled module's objects minus
  the REL units (nested `$<FILTER:$<TARGET_OBJECTS:m>,EXCLUDE,regex>` of 40 names each), plus
  `tww_sdk` and Aurora when built; `native/tools/link_census.py` classifies `nm -um` into SDK (per
  library), REL, JAudio/JAZel, MSL/runtime, deferred and other (`link_census.txt`,
  `link_census_unresolved.txt`). `native/cmake/rel_units.txt` has **416** units, not 415: the
  decomp's `configure.py` has 415 `ActorRel`s plus `Rel("f_pc_profile_lst")`; 424 non-REL + 416
  REL = 840. `native/tools/symbol_census.py` reports duplicate strong definitions and weak
  definitions with differing sizes (Mach-O has no symbol sizes: distance to the next symbol or
  the section end). Deviation: in decomp header mode every unit defines the SDK hardware
  registers, so a strict link fails in every module (SSystem alone: 19 duplicates; all non-REL
  units: 30, including `JPACallBackBase*` methods and `hio_set`). By default the census therefore
  makes duplicates local in `ld -r` copies and counts them in the report;
  `TWW_LINK_CENSUS_STRICT=ON` keeps the planned behaviour (listed first, then the link stops).
  First result (decomp headers, no Aurora): 452 unresolved: SDK 316 (GX 125, OS 78, MTX 32,
  CARD 16, DVD 15, GF 11, VI 10, GD 8, PAD 8, GBA 7, AR 5, SI 1), REL 4 (`OSLink`, `OSLinkFixed`,
  `OSUnlink`, `OSSetStringTable`), JAudio/JAZel 120, other 12: `dCamera_c::eyePos` (defined
  `inline` in `d_camera.cpp`, called from `d_ev_camera.cpp`) and 11 `mDoExt_*Packet`
  constructors (defined under `#if DEBUG` in `m_Do_ext.cpp`, called from `d_debug_viewer.cpp`),
  both for 2.9 to settle. With `TWW_WITH_AURORA=ON` (still decomp headers, `tww_sdk` and Aurora
  linked): 230, of which SDK 94 (OS 56, GX 13, GF 11, GBA 7, VI 7); MTX, CARD, DVD, PAD, SI, AR
  and GD all resolve; JAudio/JAZel 120. The classifier harvests only single-line column-0
  declarations and tests plain C names against the SDK before the JAudio/JAZel and deferred
  buckets, so an SDK gap such as `OSLockMutex` called from audio code is never filed under
  JAudio (where 2.9's expected list could hide it); the bundle relinks when the census scripts
  change, so the POST_BUILD report always reflects the current classifier.
- **2.6a OS threads, interrupts, mutexes, messages, alarms, contexts:** `native/sdk/src/os/`
  (`OSThread`, `OSInterrupt`, `OSMutex`, `OSMessage`, `OSAlarm`, `OSContext`, internal
  `os_internal.h`), adapted from Dusklight's `OSThread.cpp`/`OSMutex.cpp`/`OSContext.cpp` and the
  message queues of `stubs.cpp` (provenance in each file). Model: "interrupts disabled" is one
  process-wide lock held per thread with the GameCube's boolean Disable/Restore semantics; every OS
  function runs under it and uses the SDK's own algorithms (priority-ordered thread queues,
  `OSSleepThread`/`OSWakeupThread`, active-thread list, joinable vs detached, mutexes on
  `thread->queueMutex` released on exit/cancel), so there are no per-object side tables. Blocked
  threads wait on their own condition variable, which releases the lock even if the caller had
  interrupts disabled (as a thread switch restores the next thread's MSR). `OSCreateThread`
  threads are detached pthreads launched by the first `OSResumeThread` (host stack ≥ 1 MiB);
  `OSExitThread` ends the thread (`pthread_exit`) and `OSJoinThread` returns the full 64-bit value.
  Alarms (D6) fire on a real host timer thread that calls handlers with the lock held; handlers
  that block abort. Deviations: priorities order nothing (phase 6); `OSSuspendThread`/
  `OSCancelThread` on another thread running game code act at its next OS call (logged); the
  switch-thread callback is never called (logged once). `OSInitContext`/`OSSaveContext`/`OSLoadContext`/
  `OSSwitchStack`/`OSSwitchFiber` abort; `OSGetStackPointer` returns 0. New
  `native/sdk/include/tww_sdk/hooks.h`: `TWWSdkRequestShutdown` (blocking message calls return
  FALSE, alarms stop) and `TWWSdkSetThreadStartHook` (per-thread setup such as the current
  `JKRHeap`, replacing Dusklight's game couplings). Tests `threads` and `alarms`
  (`native/sdk/tests/sdk_threads.cpp`, 1000-message ping-pong, mutex/cond counter, cancel,
  periodic/cancelled/re-arming alarms, JFWDisplay's alarm-resume-self-suspend). TSan: new target
  `tww_sdk_smoke_tsan` (not in `all`, without `aurora::dvd`, whose Rust personality breaks the
  macOS TSan link). Xcode 26's clang 17 TSan crashes at start-up on macOS 26.6 even for an empty
  program, so the run uses `build/native-mac-tsan` configured with the Command Line Tools clang
  21 (recipe in `native/sdk/README.md`): 10 runs + 40 runs of `threads alarms`, no report. Census
  with `TWW_WITH_AURORA=ON`: SDK/OS 56 → 18 (the rest is 2.6b: reset, console, PPC, `__OSBusClock`).
- **2.6b OS misc:** `native/sdk/src/os/{OSReport,OSMisc,OSReset,OSSram,PPC,LC}.cpp`, adapted from
  Dusklight's `OSReport.cpp` and the OS/PPC parts of `stubs.cpp` (provenance in each file).
  `OSReport`/`OSVReport`/`OSPanic` are defined by the game (`m_Do_printf.cpp`), so tww_sdk only has
  weak defaults (stderr; `OSPanic` aborts) in a file that defines nothing else: the archive member
  is never loaded when the game is linked (the census bundle uses the game's strong ones).
  `OSFatal`, `PPCHalt`, `PPCMtdmaL` with the trigger bit and the IPL-font getters abort.
  `OSResetSystem` runs the SDK's priority-ordered reset functions (non-final passes until all are
  ready, then the final pass with interrupts disabled), records the reset code (hot reset: the code;
  restart: `0x80000000`) and the saved region, then calls the new reset hook
  (`TWWSdkSetResetHook` in `hooks.h`, for phase 6 to restart the game); it never returns: without a
  hook, or if the hook returns, it logs, calls `TWWSdkRequestShutdown` and ends the process with
  exit code 0 (TWW spins after the call). SRAM is the SDK's lock/unlock/checksum model over an
  in-memory copy (stereo, NTSC, interlaced, English; not persisted), declared with the RTC
  functions in the new `tww_sdk/sram.h`; `OSGetSoundMode` returns 0/1 as on the console (Dusklight
  returns 2). PPC registers are emulated values: MSR[EE] is the interrupt state, MSR/FPSCR are per
  thread, the decrementer counts at the timer clock, HID2[LCE] reads set (Aurora's locked cache is
  always usable; `d_a_movie_player` checks it), and settings the host cannot honour (FP exception
  enables, non-IEEE mode, performance counters, memory protection) are logged once. Aurora's
  `OSCache.cpp` already has the cache ranges and `LC*` copies; `LC.cpp` adds the rest (`DCBlockZero`
  clears its block; the others do nothing). `__OSBusClock` is a real variable for the decomp
  headers (Aurora makes it a low-memory read). `OSSetErrorHandler` records handlers
  (`TWWSdkGetErrorHandler` for later glue). Test `misc` (`native/sdk/tests/sdk_misc.cpp`, death
  checks in forked children with captured stderr); 20 runs of the whole smoke program and 10 TSan
  runs, no failure or report. Census with `TWW_WITH_AURORA=ON`: SDK/OS 18 → 0 (total 192 → 174).
- **2.6c VI retrace and GX gaps:** `native/sdk/src/vi/VIRetrace.cpp` and
  `native/sdk/src/gx/GXExtras.cpp`, adapted from the VI and GX sections of Dusklight's `stubs.cpp`
  (provenance in each file); the GX list is the plan's plus the census's SDK/GX bucket
  (`GXInitTexCacheRegion`, `GXPeekARGB`, `GXPokeAlphaRead`, `GXReadXfRasMetric` besides the
  planned names). Each `VIWaitForRetrace` call is one retrace, run as the SDK's handler does
  (count, pre-retrace callback, next frame buffer latched, post-retrace callback) with interrupts
  disabled; it does not pace (phase 6). `VISetBlack` is recorded for the glue
  (`TWWSdkVIIsBlack` in `hooks.h`; Aurora keeps presenting, logged once), `VIGetNextField`
  alternates with the retrace count, `VIGetDTVStatus` is 0 (no progressive-scan prompt).
  `GXGetNumXfbLines`/`GXGetYScaleFactor` and `GXInitTexCacheRegion` use the SDK's algorithms
  (Dusklight returns 0, which would size JUTXfb's buffers to 0 lines). The GX thread is kept as in
  the SDK, starting as the default (main) OS thread (new `DefaultThreadLocked` in `os_internal.h`),
  since `mDoRst_reset` cancels it when it is not the caller. `GXSetDrawSync` delivers the token at
  once, inside the call (Aurora's public API has no GPU-signalled token). Logged once where the host
  differs: draw sync, `GXSetMisc(GX_MT_DL_SAVE_CONTEXT, 0)` (Aurora's private `dlSaveContext` stays
  1), `GXPeekARGB` (no EFB colour read-back: white, alpha from `GXPokeAlphaRead`, which d_snap reads
  as "no object"; TODO phase 6), the counters (0); `GXAbortFrame` logs every call.
  `GXGetFifoBase`/`GXGetFifoSize` abort (Aurora's FIFO objects keep no base or size; nothing in TWW calls them). Not added:
  `GXWaitDrawDone` is static in TWW's SDK, and the metric functions beyond TWW's three. Tests `vi`
  (the plan's three retraces, plus frame buffer latch, fields, 1000 retraces from two threads) and
  `gx` (`native/sdk/tests/sdk_vi.cpp`); 20 runs of the whole smoke program and 10 TSan runs, no
  failure or report. Census with `TWW_WITH_AURORA=ON`: SDK/GX 13 → 0, SDK/VI 7 → 0 (total
  174 → 154). Reviewed in round 1: smoke `vi`/`gx`, 18 more whole-program runs and 8 TSan runs
  clean, census reproduced, default configuration (`tww_modules` and checks) unchanged.
- **2.6d GF:** TWW's `native/tww/src/dolphin/gf/GF{Geometry,Light,Pixel,Tev,Transform}.cpp`
  compiled into `tww_sdk` through an OBJECT library `tww_sdk_gf` in its own
  `native/cmake/sdk_gf.cmake` (included after `sdk.cmake`), against Aurora's headers plus the
  `native/include/sdk` forwarders and `tww_gf_extras.h`, whatever `TWW_SDK_HEADERS` is, as Dusklight
  compiles TP's GF. Aurora's `GXCmd1u*` write into the same FIFO outside a display list as inside
  one, and its command processor parses `LOAD_BP/CP/XF_REG` in both, so GF needs no shim. One
  `TARGET_PC` edit: Aurora ignores `CP_REG_ARRAYBASE` (logs "not supported"), so the new
  `GFSetArraySized(attr, ptr, size, stride, le)` writes `GX_AURORA_LOAD_ARRAYBASE` with the 64-bit
  pointer as Aurora's `GDSetArraySized` does, and `GFSetArray` (no size) stops with `OSPanic`;
  its callers (`m_Do_graphic`, `d_tree`, `d_grass`) switch in step 2.7. Test `gf`
  (`native/sdk/tests/sdk_gf.cpp`): each GF call recorded in a GX display list equals Aurora's GD
  function of the same name byte for byte; `GFSetCullMode`, `GFBegin`/vertex writers and
  `GFSetArraySized` against hand-encoded commands; `GFSetArray`'s panic in a forked child. 20 runs
  of the whole smoke program and 10 TSan runs, no failure or report. Census with
  `TWW_WITH_AURORA=ON` (decomp headers): SDK/GF 11 → 9 (total 154 → 152); the 9 left differ only
  in the decomp's enum tags (`_GXAttr` vs Aurora's `GXAttr`) in the mangled names, and resolve
  once the callers compile against Aurora's headers (2.7); the smoke test, which includes GF.h
  through the forwarder, links against them.
  THP: no replacement decoder is needed in `native/sdk`; Aurora's `aurora_thp` (already linked)
  provides `THPInit`/`THPVideoDecode`/`THPAudioDecode`, and the actors step that compiles
  `d_a_movie_player.cpp` puts its PPC-asm decoder under `#if !TARGET_PC` and calls Aurora's, as
  Dusklight does. Reviewed in round 1: GF units rebuilt, `nm` shows the 15 GF functions, smoke
  `gf` and the whole program ok, census reproduced (SDK/GF 9, total 152), default configuration
  (`tww_modules` and checks) unchanged.
- **2.6e Devices:** new `native/sdk/src/{ar,gba,exi,si,db}/*.cpp` (globbed; no CMake change).
  A scan of every compiled unit (REL ones included) against `tww_sdk` and the Aurora libraries
  found only the 7 `GBA*` functions of `JUTGba` missing among these prefixes, plus
  `ARGetBaseAddress` for JAudio (`JASSystemHeap`, phase 5). Every DVD name the plan lists is
  already in `aurora_dvd`, and the CARD icon/banner accessors are macros in Aurora's `card.h`, so
  no `dvd/` or `card/` file was needed; the SDK-internal `__DVD*` and unused `CARD*`
  (`CARDErase`, `CARDProgram`, vendor/disk-ID) stay undefined. Added: AR (`ARStartDMA` as an
  immediate copy between a MEM1 physical address and Aurora's ARAM buffer, `ARGetStorageAddress`
  standing in for its private `aramToHost`, callback with interrupts disabled, `ARGetDMAStatus` 0,
  fatal on any range outside MEM1/ARAM; `ARGetBaseAddress` 0x4000, the value Aurora's `ARInit`
  returns, so JKRAram and JAudio agree; `ARClear`, `ARGetInternalSize`, and the always-empty ARQ
  queue functions), GBA (every request `GBA_NOT_READY`, async ones refused without callback,
  `GBAGetProcessStatus` `GBA_READY` = idle), EXI (real lock/unlock queue from the decomp's
  EXIBios.c, no device answers a selection), SI extras (`SIGetType`/`SIGetStatus` over Aurora's
  `SIProbe`, `SITransfer` completing with `SI_ERROR_NO_RESPONSE` on the alarm thread, the SDK's
  poll word and polling-handler table), DB (host `__DBInterface` with no debugger, the OdemuExi2
  link refusing reads and writes, `__DBExceptionDestination` aborting) and amcstubs (the SDK's own
  no-op stubs). Tests `ar` (4 KB round trip through `ARStartDMA` both ways, also seen by Aurora's
  ARQ; aborts for a console address and an ARAM overrun), `gba`, `exi`, `si`, `db`
  (`native/sdk/tests/sdk_devices.cpp`, which sets `AuroraConfig.mem1Size`/`mem2Size` for the smoke
  program). 20 runs of the whole smoke program and 10 TSan runs, no failure or report. Census
  with `TWW_WITH_AURORA=ON` (decomp headers): SDK/GBA 7 → 0, total 152 → 145, duplicates still 30;
  the only SDK names left are 2.6d's 9 GF enum-tag manglings.
  Reviewed in round 1: smoke `ar`/`gba`/`exi`/`si`/`db` and the whole program ok (5 runs), 5 TSan
  runs clean, census reproduced (SDK/GF 9, total 145), no tww_sdk/Aurora symbol overlap, default
  configuration (`tww_modules` and checks) unchanged; `GBAGetProcessStatus` = `GBA_READY` accepted
  (the SDK's idle value; JUTGba ignores the result).
- **2.6f Audio hardware (silent) and MSL extras:** new `native/sdk/src/audio/{AIStubs,DSPStubs,DTK}.cpp`
  and `native/sdk/src/runtime/extras.c` (globbed), tests `audio` and `msl`
  (`native/sdk/tests/sdk_audio.cpp`). AI: a register model that plays nothing (settings read back,
  `AIGetDSPSampleRate` in the SDK encoding, 1 before `AIInit` and 0 after, as `d_a_movie_player`
  expects; no interrupt or callback ever; `AIInitDMA` keeps the `uintptr_t`, `AIGetDMAStartAddr`
  aborts when it does not fit a u32). DSP: mail to the DSP taken at once, none back, the SDK's task
  list, `__DSP_boot_task`/`__DSP_exec_task` log once and never wait; `DSPAddTask` weak (JAudio's
  `osdsp.c` overrides it). DTK: Dusklight's `libs/dolphin` dtk.c copied as C++ over the silent AI
  and Aurora's synchronous DVD stream commands (TWW never calls it; left out of the TSan target,
  which links no `aurora::dvd`). `stricmp`/`strnicmp` from Dusklight's `extras.c`, compared as
  unsigned char. Census (Aurora on, decomp headers): MSL/runtime 0, no SDK/audio bucket, total 145
  (both were already 0; the real consumers, JAudio/JAZelAudio, come in 3.7). Open for 3.7/phase 5:
  JAudio's own DSP handshake loops spin with no DSP; Aurora's `<dolphin/dsp.h>` lacks the
  `__DSP_*` task declarations `osdsp_task.c` needs in aurora-header mode.
  Reviewed in round 1: new files rebuilt, smoke `audio`/`msl` and the whole program ok (6 runs),
  3 TSan runs clean, census reproduced, no audio/MSL name of any compiled unit unresolved against
  tww_sdk and Aurora, DTK.cpp matches Dusklight's dtk.c apart from the listed changes, default
  configuration (`tww_modules` and checks) unchanged.
- **2.7 SSystem:** compiles in aurora header mode (36/36 units, 0 errors) and still in decomp mode.
  Fixes are headers only, under `TARGET_PC`: Aurora's `GXColor`/`GXRenderModeObj` are typedefs of
  unnamed structs, so the forward `typedef struct _GX* ...` lines go (`c_cc_d.h` includes
  `dolphin/gx/GXStruct.h`; `JUTXfb.h`/`JFWDisplay.h` already get it through `JUTVideo.h`);
  `JUTVideo::isAntiAliasing` reads Aurora's `aa` (same u8 at 0x19) under `defined(TWW_SDK_AURORA)`,
  which the aurora-only `tww_sdk_extras.h` defines (TODO 2.8: remove with decomp mode); `global.h`
  undefines Aurora's `ASSERT` before its own (both empty without `DEBUG`). No `STATIC_ASSERT`
  fired. Pattern for later modules: the other `typedef struct _GX*` forwards (`m_Do_lib.h`,
  `J3DModelData.h`, `JUTException.h`, ...) and `JFWDisplay.cpp`'s `antialiasing` need the same fix.
  Aurora-mode builds use the gitignored `build/native-mac-aurora` (offline, sources from
  `build/native-mac/_deps` and `build/aurora-3227d76`). Reviewed in round 1: SSystem rebuilt
  from clean in aurora mode with the shadow, header and scaffold checks and smoke ok; default
  configuration (`tww_modules` and checks) rebuilt, 0 errors.
- **2.7 JSystem-core:** compiles in aurora header mode (all units of the module, 0 errors) and still
  in decomp mode. First aurora build: 552 errors in 17 files, 463 of them `GXFIFO` from the
  `JSystem.pch` headers (`J3DShape.h`, `J3DGD.h`). Fixes in the forwarders: `dolphin/os/OS.h` gets
  the decomp's `OSRoundUp`/`OSRoundDown` (+`Ptr`, through `uintptr_t`), `OS_ERROR_MEMORY_PROTECTION`
  (Aurora's `OS_ERROR_PROTECTION`), `OS_ERROR_FLOATING_POINT_EXCEPTION`, the `OSException` enum and
  `OSContextPPC`/`OSContextPPCOf`, a view of the PowerPC register image over Aurora's opaque
  `OSContext` storage (same 0x2C8 size, `static_assert`ed); `dolphin/gx/GX.h` gets the decomp's
  `GX_BL_*` blend-factor spellings. Fixes in `native/tww`, all under `TARGET_PC` with the original
  kept: `JRNLoadCPCmd`/`JRNLoadXFCmdHdr`/`J3DCurrentMtx::load`/`J3DGXCmd1f32ptr`/`J3DFifo*` write
  through `GXCmd1u8/u16/u32` (the decomp's inline `GXFIFO` writes in decomp mode); `JSystem.pch`
  includes `global.h`, which the decomp reached through its GX headers; `JFWSystem.h` and
  `JUTException.h` include `GXStruct.h` instead of the `_GXRenderModeObj` forward; and, under
  `defined(TWW_SDK_AURORA)` (TODO 2.8), Aurora's field names (`aa`, `DVDFileInfo::cb/startAddr`,
  `DVDDirEntry::isDir/entryNum`, `OSBootInfo::memorySize`, `OSThread::stackBase/stackEnd`), the
  typed `OSCreateThread` entry point (`JKRThread`, `JUTGba`), `JKRAramPiece::doneDMA(uintptr_t)`
  for Aurora's `ARQCallback` (TODO phase 4: `JKRAMCommand::AsyncCallback` still takes `u32`), and
  `JUTException.cpp` reading register fields through `JUT_CONTEXT(context)` (identity outside
  aurora mode). No `STATIC_ASSERT` fired (they are empty outside Metrowerks). `J3DShape.cpp`'s own
  `GXFIFO` writes belong to the J3D step. Reviewed in round 1: SSystem and JSystem-core rebuilt
  from clean in aurora mode (89 units, 0 errors) with the shadow, header and scaffold checks and smoke
  ok; JSystem-core rebuilt from clean in the default configuration and `tww_modules` and checks clean.
- **2.7 JSystem-J3D:** compiles in aurora header mode (all 31 units, 0 errors) and still in decomp
  mode. First aurora build: 26 of 31 units failed, 106 distinct errors (clang's 50-per-unit limit
  hid none beyond them). Fixes in the forwarders: `dolphin/gx/GX.h` includes Aurora's
  `<dolphin/gd/GDGeometry.h>` for the BP/CP/XF register numbers (`GX_BP_REG_SETMODE0_TEX*`,
  `GX_BP_REG_TEVCOLORCOMBINER0`, ...), which the decomp's `GX.h` exports through its `GXEnum.h`
  (all 318 shared names have the same values), and maps `GX_MAXCOORD`/`GX_TEXMAP_DISABLE` to Aurora's
  `GX_MAX_TEXCOORD`/`GX_TEX_DISABLE`. Fixes in `native/tww`, all under `TARGET_PC` with the original
  kept: `J3DLoadCPCmd` (`J3DShape.cpp`) writes through `GXCmd1u8/u32`; `J3DVertex.h` and
  `J3DModelData.h` include `GXStruct.h` instead of the `_GXColor` forward; and, under
  `defined(TWW_SDK_AURORA)` (TODO 2.8), `GXFogAdjTable::r` (the decomp's `fogVals`) in `J3DGD.cpp`,
  `GDGetCurrPointer` as Aurora's `u8*` `GDGetCurrPointer2` in `J3DMatBlock.cpp`, and
  `J3DSys::setModelDrawMtx`/`setModelNrmMtx` calling Aurora's 5-argument `GXSETARRAY` with host byte
  order and the whole 16-bit index range as the size (GX has no bound; TODO phase 4: pass the
  model's real matrix count so Aurora's indexed-load check bites). No `STATIC_ASSERT` fired.
  Aurora mode: SSystem, JSystem-core, JSystem-J3D, `tww_sdk`, smoke, scaffold, header and shadow
  checks (82 names, ok) build; default configuration: `tww_modules` and checks rebuilt (622 steps),
  0 errors.
  Reviewed in round 1: JSystem-J3D rebuilt from clean in aurora mode (31 units, 0 errors) with the
  shadow, header and scaffold checks and smoke ok, and from clean in the default configuration with
  `tww_modules` and checks clean; Aurora only pushes `size` bytes for vertex arrays, so the 16-bit
  index range for the matrix arrays affects nothing but the indexed-load bounds check.
- **2.7 JSystem-2D-particle:** compiles in aurora header mode (all 26 units of J2DGraph and JParticle,
  0 errors) and still in decomp mode. First aurora build: one unit failed (`JPABaseShape.cpp`) with 5
  errors, the decomp's `GXLogicOp` spellings `GX_LO_REV_AND`, `GX_LO_INV_AND`, `GX_LO_REV_OR`,
  `GX_LO_INV_COPY` and `GX_LO_INV_OR`. Fixed in the forwarder only: `dolphin/gx/GX.h` maps them to
  Aurora's `GX_LO_REVAND`, ... (same values 0x2, 0x4, 0xB, 0xC, 0xD); no change in `native/tww`, no
  `STATIC_ASSERT` fired. Aurora mode: SSystem, JSystem-core, JSystem-J3D, JSystem-2D-particle,
  `tww_sdk`, smoke, scaffold, header and shadow checks (82 names, ok) build; default configuration:
  `tww_modules` and checks clean (the forwarder is not on the decomp-mode include path).
- **2.7 JSystem-studio:** compiles in aurora header mode (all 37 units of JStudio, JStage and
  JMessage, 0 errors) and still in decomp mode. First aurora build: 15 units failed with one error
  each, all from the `typedef struct _GXColor GXColor;` forward in `jstudio-object.h` (clang's
  50-per-unit limit hid nothing). Fixed as in `J3DVertex.h`: under `TARGET_PC` the header includes
  `dolphin/gx/GXStruct.h`, the original forward kept in `#else`. No forwarder change, no
  `STATIC_ASSERT` fired. Aurora mode: SSystem, JSystem-core, JSystem-J3D, JSystem-2D-particle,
  JSystem-studio (rebuilt from clean), `tww_sdk`, smoke, scaffold, header and shadow checks (82
  names, ok) build; default configuration: `tww_modules` and checks rebuilt (every includer of the
  header), 0 errors.
