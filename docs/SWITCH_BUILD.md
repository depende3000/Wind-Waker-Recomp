# Building the Switch NRO

How to build the unofficial Nintendo Switch homebrew build of Wind Waker Recomp from your own disc,
copy it and its data to the console, and read its logs. This is the **headless milestone**: the game
runs without graphics, sound or controls, and reports its progress in a log. It proves the
recompiled game code and runtime on the console before the renderer is ported. Plan and status:
[SWITCH_PORT_PLAN.md](SWITCH_PORT_PLAN.md), [SWITCH_IMPLEMENTATION_CHECKLIST.md](SWITCH_IMPLEMENTATION_CHECKLIST.md).

> [!IMPORTANT]
> The NRO contains code translated from your disc. Like every build in this repository, it is for
> your own console only: never share or upload it, the disc image or any file extracted from it
> ([AGENTS.md](../AGENTS.md)). Everything below stays in the ignored `build/` and `ref/` folders.

## What you need

- A Mac (Apple silicon) or Linux machine with Git, Python 3, CMake and Ninja.
  On macOS: `brew install cmake ninja libmtp libusb uv`.
- Docker Desktop or Podman. The scripts use the official devkitPro image, pinned by digest. It runs
  natively on Apple silicon (`linux/arm64`).
  - Give Docker at least **16 GB of memory** (Settings › Resources): the largest generated source
    files need about 3 GB each to compile.
- Your disc image of *The Legend of Zelda: The Wind Waker*, GameCube USA (`GZLE01`, revision 0), as an
  uncompressed `.iso`. The builder checks it and refuses other versions.
- A Switch you have already set up for homebrew (Atmosphère and the Homebrew Menu), a USB-C data
  cable, and the console's **USB file transfer** (Horizon's own, or haze/DBI).

## 1. Build

```sh
scripts/bootstrap.sh                                         # pinned RecompCore, DolRecomp, Aurora into ref/
scripts/builder/build.sh /path/to/GZLE01.iso --source-only   # check the disc, generate the game source
scripts/switch/build_host.sh                                 # build/switch-host/BlueWakeSwitch.nro
```

- `--source-only` extracts `main.dol` and the 415 RELs into `build/device/game` and generates the
  translated source into `build/device/composite-src` (about 900 MB of C). It takes a few minutes
  and ends with `composite source digest …: the verified tree`.
- `build_host.sh`:
  1. compiles that source as one static object, `build/switch-composite/gGZLE01_recomp.o`, with
     every symbol renamed `bwc_<name>` (`COMPOSITE_STATIC`);
  2. links it with the host, GXRuntime and the donor DSP into the NRO (`switch/host`).

  The first run takes **hours**: GCC needs 3–5 minutes for each of the largest files. Later runs
  reuse what is already compiled. `SWITCH_BUILD_JOBS` sets the parallel jobs (default 6). Use
  fewer if Docker has less memory.

If your disc image is compressed (`.ciso`, `.rvz`, …), convert it to `.iso` first. A GameCube `.iso`
is exactly 1,459,978,240 bytes.

## 2. Copy to the console

Turn on USB file transfer on the console, connect it to the computer, then:

```sh
scripts/switch/push.sh --game /path/to/GZLE01.iso   # game data: about 1.5 GB, 82 s the first time
scripts/switch/push.sh host                         # the NRO, read back and checked by SHA-256
```

`push.sh` copies over MTP and needs no SD-card reader or reboot. `--game` skips files that are
already on the console with the same size, so it is quick to rerun. The resulting SD-card layout:

| Path on the SD card | Contents | Source |
|---|---|---|
| `switch/wind-waker-recomp/BlueWakeSwitch.nro` | the app | `build/switch-host/BlueWakeSwitch.nro` |
| `switch/wind-waker-recomp/GZLE01.iso` | your disc image; the game reads its data from it | your `.iso` |
| `switch/wind-waker-recomp/dsp_rom.bin`, `dsp_coef.bin` | free replacement DSP ROMs | `ref/recompcore/Data/Sys/GC/` |
| `switch/wind-waker-recomp/game/main.dol` | the game's executable | `build/device/game/main.dol` |
| `switch/wind-waker-recomp/game/rels/*.rel` | the game's 415 modules | `build/device/game/rels/` |
| `switch/wind-waker-recomp/GZLE01.card` | memory card; created by the game | — |
| `switch/wind-waker-recomp/host.log`, `states/` | log and save states; created at run time | — |

Without USB file transfer, copy the same files with an SD-card reader, or with Hekate's
**Tools › USB Tools › SD Card**, to the paths above.

## 3. Run

Start the Homebrew Menu in **title mode**: hold **R** while you open an installed game. Launching it
from the Album gives applets far less memory than the game needs. Open **BlueWakeSwitch**.

The headless build:

- shows no picture;
- runs about one minute of game time (`BLUEWAKE_MAX_RETRACES=3600`) and then writes
  `[switch] host returned …`;
- exits with **+**.

It checks for the DOL, disc and DSP ROMs first, and logs any that are missing.

## 4. Logs and crashes

- **Live over USB.** Leave the cable connected and run, on the computer:

  ```sh
  uv run scripts/switch/usb_log.py --out build/switch-logs/live.log
  ```

  It waits for the app and prints its log as the app writes it. It runs directly on the host, not
  in a container (Docker Desktop has no USB access).
- **From the SD card.** Every line also goes to `switch/wind-waker-recomp/host.log`. With USB file
  transfer on, `scripts/switch/push.sh --logs` copies it, and the probes' logs, to
  `build/switch-logs/`.
- **Crashes.** Atmosphère writes a report to `atmosphere/crash_reports/`. Copy it with
  `build/switch-tools/switch_mtp pull atmosphere/crash_reports <name>.log out.log`, then resolve its
  addresses (`+ 0x…` after the module name) with the ELF next to the NRO:

  ```sh
  aarch64-none-elf-addr2line -f -C -i -e build/switch-host/bluewake_switch_host.elf 0x…
  ```

  `aarch64-none-elf-addr2line` is in the devkitPro image. Run it through `docker run` with the
  repository mounted, as the build scripts do.

## Probes

The graphics-feasibility probes live in `switch/` and are built and copied the same way:

```sh
scripts/switch/push.sh --build dawn gles boot
```

See [switch/README.md](../switch/README.md) and [the graphics spike](status/SWITCH_GRAPHICS_SPIKE.md).
