/*
 * pc_gpu_opts.h - opt-in GPU-side reductions of the native port, for A/B runs on the Switch
 * (docs/SWITCH_PERF_STUDY.md; native/src/pc/pc_gpu_opts.cpp).
 * All default off: with none set the game renders exactly as before.
 *
 * TWW_SHADOW_OFFSCREEN=1  the real-time shadow casters (dDlst_shadowControl_c::imageDraw) are drawn
 *                         into an offscreen target of the EFB region's pixel size (GXCreateFrameBuffer)
 *                         instead of the corner of the EFB; the I4 copies keep their size, so the
 *                         shadows look the same, but the main EFB pass is no longer broken (and
 *                         reloaded) once per shadow: at 1280x720 the shadow passes bind a 512x384 target rather
 *                         than the 1280x720 EFB, and their depth clears become full-target clears.
 * TWW_SHADOW_OFFSCREEN=gc as 1, at the GameCube's own size whatever the internal resolution: a
 *                         256x256 target and 128x128 textures (at 1280x720, a third of the caster
 *                         pixels and a quarter of the copy texels); shadow edges are softer/blockier,
 *                         as on the console. For measurement.
 *
 * The first call of each reads its variable; game code calls them on the game thread only.
