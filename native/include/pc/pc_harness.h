/*
 * pc_harness.h - the run harness of the native executable tww (docs/NATIVE_PORT_PHASE4_6.md,
 * step 6.0). Implemented in native/src/pc/pc_*.cpp, linked into tww (and into the link census
 * bundle) as the static library tww_pc. Only TARGET_PC code calls it.
 *
 * Environment (read once by pc_harness_init):
 *   TWW_DISC       path of the GZLE01 disc image (required unless the smoke test needs none)
 *   TWW_SMOKE      run one smoke test instead of the game (static-init, crash-test, ...)
 *   TWW_MILESTONE  exit 0 as soon as this milestone is logged (static-init, aurora-up, ...)
 *   TWW_TIMEOUT_S  in-process watchdog: exit 10 after this many seconds (0 or unset: off)
 *   TWW_STALL_S    exit 11 when the game frame counter is frozen this long (0 or unset: off)
 *   TWW_TRACE      comma list of trace channels: res, scene, frame (or all)
 *   TWW_UNCAPPED   1: no frame pacing and no vsync (pc_frame_pace, Aurora)
 *   TWW_AUDIO      off: audio stays silent (used from step 6.1)
 *   TWW_FRAMES     exit 0 after this many game frames
 *   TWW_RUN_DIR    directory for backtrace.txt / stall.txt (set by native/tools/tww_run.sh)
 *
 * Exit codes: see PC_EXIT_* below.
