# tww_sdk: the GameCube SDK for the native port, over Aurora

Phase 2 of the native port (`docs/NATIVE_PORT_PHASE2_3.md`). The model is Dusklight's: Aurora's
SDK libraries (`aurora::core gx gd si vi pad mtx os dvd thp card`, listed in `TWW_AURORA_LIBS`)
plus a layer of glue for what Aurora does not provide (threads, messages, alarms, VI retrace, GF,
AI/DSP, EXI, GBA, DVD extras, ...). That glue lives here.

Built only with `-DTWW_WITH_AURORA=ON` (see `native/README.md`, "Aurora (phase 2)").

## Layout

- `src/<library>/*.{c,cpp}`: the SDK functions, one directory per SDK library (`os`, `vi`, `gx`,
  `dvd`, ...). `native/cmake/sdk.cmake` globs `src/**/*.{c,cpp}` with `CONFIGURE_DEPENDS`, so adding
  a file needs no CMake change (re-running `ninja` picks it up).
- `include/tww_sdk/`: the library's own headers (hooks the game glue sets, information functions).
  This directory is on `tww_sdk`'s public include path.
- `tests/`: the headless test program `tww_sdk_smoke` (no window, no GPU). Every `tests/*.cpp` is
  globbed; each file registers its tests by name with `TWW_SMOKE_TEST(name)` from `tests/smoke.h`.

## Rules

- Compiled against **Aurora's headers only**: never `native/tww/include` and never the game's flags
  (`tww_game_headers`). The SDK's own declarations come from `<dolphin/...>` as Aurora ships them;
  TWW-only declarations go into the forwarders of `native/include/sdk` (steps 2.3 and 2.4).
- `MTX_USE_PS=1` is public on `tww_sdk`, as in Dusklight's game flags.
- Code adapted from Dusklight (`ref/dusklight/src/dusk`, CC0) starts with a provenance comment
  naming the original file and what changed (decision D7). Code adapted from Aurora (MIT) keeps
  its notice.
- Hardware-only functions may be stubs only where the plan says so. A stub whose silent result
  would hide a bug logs it, and `OSPanic`/`OSFatal` abort.
- The SDK layer itself is 64-bit correct (pointers are `uintptr_t`, never `u32`).

## Building and running the test

```sh
cmake -S native -B build/native-mac -G Ninja -DTWW_WITH_AURORA=ON
ninja -C build/native-mac tww_sdk tww_sdk_smoke
build/native-mac/tww_sdk_smoke            # every test; prints "ok"
build/native-mac/tww_sdk_smoke basic      # only the named tests
build/native-mac/tww_sdk_smoke --list
```

`basic` (step 2.2) checks `OSInit`, `OSGetTime` and `PSMTXConcat`. Aurora's `OSInit` does not need
`aurora_initialize`: with the default (zeroed) config it allocates no MEM1 and leaves the arena
unset, which is enough for the time and matrix functions.

`threads` and `alarms` (step 2.6a, `tests/sdk_threads.cpp`): two OS threads exchange 1000
messages each way through blocking message queues and are joined (one ends through
`OSExitThread` with a 64-bit value); four threads count under a recursive `OSMutex` while the main
thread waits on an `OSCond`; `OSSleepThread`/`OSWakeupThread` with interrupts disabled,
self-suspension, thread-specific storage, `OSCancelThread` on a blocked thread; one-shot, ordered,
cancelled, tagged, periodic and self-re-arming alarms, and JFWDisplay's "set an alarm that resumes
me, then suspend myself with interrupts disabled".

### ThreadSanitizer run

`tww_sdk_smoke_tsan` (not in `all`) builds the same tests and `src/` with `-fsanitize=thread` and
must print `ok` with no TSan report. Xcode 26's Apple clang 17 TSan runtime crashes at start-up on
macOS 26.6 (even for an empty program), so it is built in its own build directory with the
Command Line Tools clang (21), reusing the fetched sources of the main build directory:

```sh
D=$PWD/build/native-mac/_deps
cmake -S native -B build/native-mac-tsan -G Ninja -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=RelWithDebInfo \
  -DTWW_WITH_AURORA=ON \
  -DCMAKE_C_COMPILER=/Library/Developer/CommandLineTools/usr/bin/clang \
  -DCMAKE_CXX_COMPILER=/Library/Developer/CommandLineTools/usr/bin/clang++ \
  -DFETCHCONTENT_SOURCE_DIR_AURORA=$PWD/build/aurora-3227d76 \
  -DFETCHCONTENT_SOURCE_DIR_ABSEIL-CPP=$D/abseil-cpp-src -DFETCHCONTENT_SOURCE_DIR_FMT=$D/fmt-src \
  -DFETCHCONTENT_SOURCE_DIR_DAWN_PREBUILT=$D/dawn_prebuilt-src \
  -DFETCHCONTENT_SOURCE_DIR_NOD_PREBUILT=$D/nod_prebuilt-src \
  -DFETCHCONTENT_SOURCE_DIR_IMGUI=$D/imgui-src -DFETCHCONTENT_SOURCE_DIR_SDL=$D/sdl-src \
  -DFETCHCONTENT_SOURCE_DIR_TRACY=$D/tracy-src -DFETCHCONTENT_SOURCE_DIR_XXHASH=$D/xxhash-src
ninja -C build/native-mac-tsan tww_sdk_smoke_tsan
build/native-mac-tsan/tww_sdk_smoke_tsan
```

If a race is found and the report hangs while symbolizing (`atos`), rerun with
`TSAN_OPTIONS=symbolize=0`. With a toolchain whose TSan works, `ninja tww_sdk_smoke_tsan` in the main build directory is enough.

## OS threads, interrupts and alarms (step 2.6a)

`src/os/` holds the host implementation; `src/os/os_internal.h` describes the model. In short:
"interrupts disabled" is one process-wide lock held per thread with the GameCube's boolean
semantics, every OS function runs under it, blocked threads wait on their own condition variable
(which releases the lock), `OSCreateThread` threads are detached pthreads launched by the first
`OSResumeThread`, and alarms fire on a real host timer thread that calls the handlers with the lock
held (decision D6). Differences from the console that game code can notice: threads run in
parallel and priorities order nothing (phase 6), and `OSSuspendThread`/`OSCancelThread` on
another thread that is running game code act at its next OS call (both are logged).
`OSInitContext`, `OSSaveContext`, `OSLoadContext`, `OSSwitchStack` and `OSSwitchFiber` abort.

`include/tww_sdk/hooks.h` replaces Dusklight's couplings to the game: `TWWSdkRequestShutdown`
(blocking message-queue calls return FALSE, alarms stop) and `TWWSdkSetThreadStartHook` (runs on
each new OS thread before its entry function; the game glue sets the thread's current `JKRHeap`
there, since the switch-thread callback is never called on host threads).
