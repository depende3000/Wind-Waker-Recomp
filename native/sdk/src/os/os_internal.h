// tww_sdk: state shared by the host implementation of the OS thread, interrupt, mutex, message
// and alarm functions (native/sdk/src/os/*.cpp). Internal to tww_sdk.
//
// The model (docs/NATIVE_PORT_PHASE2_3.md, step 2.6a):
//
// - On the GameCube the whole OS is protected by disabling interrupts: one CPU, and nothing else
//   can run while interrupts are off. Here one process-wide host mutex, Lock(), plays that part.
//   OSDisableInterrupts() takes it and OSRestoreInterrupts()/OSEnableInterrupts() give it back.
//   "Interrupts disabled" is a per-thread boolean (tInterruptsDisabled), as MSR[EE] is part of each
//   thread's context on the GameCube, so nested Disable/Restore pairs behave as on the console.
// - Every SDK function that touches OS state holds Lock() (a Guard), so all OS bookkeeping
//   (OSThread fields, thread queues, mutexes, message queues, the alarm queue) is serialised.
// - A thread that blocks (OSSleepThread, OSLockMutex, OSWaitCond, OSReceiveMessage, OSJoinThread,
//   self-suspension) waits on its own condition variable, which releases Lock() while it sleeps,
//   even when the caller had disabled interrupts. That matches the console, where the thread switch
//   restores the next thread's interrupt state. Each OSThread has a HostThread with that variable.
// - Alarms fire on a real host timer thread (decision D6), which calls the handlers while holding
//   Lock(), as an interrupt handler runs with interrupts disabled.
// - Threads made by OSCreateThread are detached host threads (pthreads). They are never joined at
//   host level: OSJoinThread waits on the OSThread state, as the console does.
//
// Differences from the console that game code can notice (phase 6 work, see the plan):
// - Threads run in parallel. OSResumeThread of a higher-priority thread does not run it at once,
//   and priorities do not order anything.
// - OSSuspendThread and OSCancelThread on another thread that is running game code take effect at
//   that thread's next tww_sdk OS call (a "checkpoint"); both are logged.
