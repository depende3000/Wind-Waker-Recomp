/* tww_sdk: MSL-only C library extras the host C library lacks (docs/NATIVE_PORT_PHASE2_3.md,
 * step 2.6f).
 *
 * MSL's <extras.h> declares stricmp and strnicmp (case-insensitive compares); macOS and Linux
 * only have strcasecmp/strncasecmp. No other MSL-only name is needed: a scan of all 840 compiled
 * game units (REL units included) against tww_sdk, the Aurora libraries and the host C/C++
 * libraries leaves no MSL/runtime symbol unresolved, and JSystem/JAudio and JAZelAudio (compiled
 * in phase 3.7) call none either. __dcbz and __cntlzw, which Dusklight defines next to these,
 * are inline in native/include/pc/tww_pc_config.h.
 *
 * Both return -1, 0 or 1 and compare the lower-cased characters, as MSL's do. The characters go
 * through unsigned char before tolower: char is unsigned on the GameCube's PowerPC, so bytes
 * >= 0x80 compare by their unsigned value as they did there (and tolower of a negative char, as
 * the host's signed char would give, is undefined).
 *
 * Provenance: adapted from Dusklight src/dusk/extras.c (CC0, ref/dusklight), keeping only the
 * string functions. Changed: the unsigned char conversion, and strnicmp's locals are ints.
