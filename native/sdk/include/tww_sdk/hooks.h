// ---- Shutdown ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------

// Marks the process as shutting down (Dusklight's dusk::IsShuttingDown = true). Afterwards:
// - OSSendMessage, OSJamMessage and OSReceiveMessage with OS_MESSAGE_BLOCK return FALSE instead of
//   waiting, and the threads already waiting in them wake up and return FALSE;
// - the alarm timer thread stops calling alarm handlers.
// Other waits (OSSleepThread, OSLockMutex, OSWaitCond, OSJoinThread) are not interrupted. Threads
// made by OSCreateThread are detached host threads, so none of them keeps the process alive.
// It cannot be undone.

// ---- Per-thread state -------------------------------------------------------------------------

// On the GameCube JKRThreadSwitch gives each thread its own current JKRHeap from the switch-thread
// callback. Host threads run in parallel and never "switch", so tww_sdk never calls the
// OSSetSwitchThreadCallback callback; the game glue uses these two hooks instead to set up
// per-thread state such as the thread's current heap.
//
// The launch hook is called when OSResumeThread starts the host thread of an OSCreateThread thread
// (its first resume), on the thread that called OSResumeThread, with interrupts disabled; it must
// not block. On the GameCube that resume is where the new thread first gets switched to, so the
// hook captures what the new thread inherits from the resuming thread. Its result is passed to the
// start hook as launchValue (NULL without a launch hook).
//
// The start hook is called on every thread made by OSCreateThread, on that thread, right before its
// entry function. Each setter returns the previous hook. NULL removes it.

// the process main thread, through its first OSGetCurrentThread or other OS call) runs as this
// record, as the GameCube's boot thread does. The address is fixed from static initialisation on,
// so game glue can bind a game-side name to it (m_Do_main.cpp's mainThread) before it is claimed.

// Called by OSResetSystem after the registered reset functions ran (final pass included), with
// interrupts back at the caller's level. On the GameCube OSResetSystem never returns: the console
// reboots (OS_RESET_RESTART), restarts the game (OS_RESET_HOTRESET) or stops (OS_RESET_SHUTDOWN).
// The game glue (phase 6) does the host equivalent here and must not return: it ends the process,
// or ends the calling OS thread (OSExitThread) while another thread restarts the game. If no hook
// is set, or the hook returns, OSResetSystem logs, calls TWWSdkRequestShutdown and ends the process
// with exit code 0 (the game would otherwise spin forever after the call). Returns the previous
// hook. NULL removes it.

// the game in a new process and passes the code along. OSResetSystem sets it itself: the reset code

// GameCube errors calls them through this.

// game has blanked the video output; the game glue (phase 6) presents black frames while it is
// TRUE.

// field (~16.7 ms) apart; the host makes them on demand, often back to back, and JUTVideo's
// measured retrace interval (JFWDisplay::calcCombinationRatio loops by it) must never be 0.
